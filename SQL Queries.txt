1. Do males score higher than females on exams and assignments in each class?

//Gets the average score for males in the class and assignment since even id is male
SELECT Distinct TRUNC(AVG(grade),2) 
AS male_average FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = '$course' 
AND grade.assignment_name = '$item'
AND grade.student_id LIKE '%0'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%2'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%4'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%6'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%8';

//Gets the average score for females in the class and assignment since odd id is female
SELECT Distinct TRUNC(AVG(grade),2) 
AS female_average FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = '$item' 
AND grade.assignment_name = '$course'
AND grade.student_id LIKE '%1'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%3'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%5'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%7'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%9';
//compare the two and see which one is better, perhaps makes a table, or we can display differences between final grade in courses, which I would need to make a query for.

2. Is the balance of males to females different balanced in every class, as in do the different sexes sign up for specific courses?

//displaying info in some sort of tablw could be beneficial.
SELECT Distinct Count(*)
AS males_in_course FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = '$course' 
AND grade.student_id LIKE '%0'
R grade.student_id LIKE '%2'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%4'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%6'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%8';

SELECT Distinct Count(*)
AS females_in_course FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = 'ABE2062' 
AND grade.student_id LIKE '%1'
R grade.student_id LIKE '%3'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%5'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%7'
OR grade.student_id LIKE '%9';

3. Average in each assignment for each class, each student? 

SELECT distinct TRUNC(AVG(grade),2) 
AS average FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = '$course' 
AND grade.assignment_name = '$item'

4. Comparison between average grade and amount of students in class, as in do more students mean a higher or lower average.

SELECT distinct COUNT(*) as Total_Number_of_Students, TRUNC(AVG(grade),2) as Average_Student_Grade
FROM grade 
where grade.course_name = '$course';
//Need to figure out a way to output accurate average, as in weight of assingments
