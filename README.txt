CastroK,password to log in as a professor. 

The tables that I have created are called student, professor, course. Open up SQL dev and just view these using sql commands to see
their attributes. I havent created a table for grades yet. Right now it's a bit confusing because, the student has 4 classes but the same
professor teaches those classes. I'll make the data a bit more realistic later but it's good enough for testing. I chose the name
GatorLearning as a placeholder. Feel free to make suggestions
